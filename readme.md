## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first time using BEM CSS, wanted to start using this because I thought it made working with CSS cleaner and a little bit easier and it definitely was. Also applied some insights for accessibility for this challenge.

### Continued development

Will definitely continue working on writing better accessibility and also will definitely continue working with BEM CSS.
